# Rent_and_Roll
Software Project for CS 520 UMASS
The project is about creating a digital car rental management system. The main objective of the project is to automate administrative functions for a car rental company like making car rental bookings, managing those bookings, storing customer data and car owner data and on-demand searching through past records of bookings, customer data and owner data. The intended user of the system is an admin of a car rental  anagement firm. There are a lot of issues with manual car rental systems that serve as our motivation for developing a digital car rental management system.
